# Installation

## Installing Ruby on Rails
Open up a command line prompt. On Mac OS X open Terminal.app, on Windows choose "Run" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:

A number of tools exist to help you quickly install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your system. Windows users can use Rails Installer, while Mac OS X users can use Tokaido. **$ ruby -v ruby 2.0.0p353**

If you don't have Ruby installed have a look at ruby-lang.org for possible ways to install Ruby on your platform.

Many popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. Windows users and others can find installation instructions at the SQLite3 website. **Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH: $ sqlite3 --version**

The program should report its version.

**To install Rails**, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems: **$ gem install rails**

To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following: $ rails --version

If it says something like **"Rails 4.2.0", you are ready to continue**.
